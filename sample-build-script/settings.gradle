// Use the key (defined in gradle.properties) as root project name instead of folder 
// name. This is mainly due to the fact that jenkins clones the git repo in  a folder 
// named ${JENKINS_HOME}/sharedspace@${EXECUTOR_NUMBER}/ which has nothing to do with 
// the project name...
rootProject.name = key
